# Sonos Live Activity Relay

A small Node.js + TypeScript service that subscribes to Sonos UPnP events on
your LAN, pushes the corresponding Live Activity updates to the Charm for
Sonos iOS app via Apple's APNs HTTP/2 endpoint, and can run Hue Ambience
while the iPhone app is suspended.

The point: keep the iPhone Lock Screen Live Activity fresh **without** the
iOS app needing to run in the background. UPnP eventing means we don't poll
Sonos — the speakers themselves push state changes (track / play / pause /
group changes) to the relay within ~100 ms, the relay forwards them through
APNs, and the Live Activity updates within another ~1–3 s.

## Phase 1 scope

- LAN-only HTTP (no auth, no TLS — fine for inside a tailnet / home LAN).
- Relay discovery is automatic on the local subnet: the relay publishes a
  Bonjour service (`_charmrelay._tcp`) and the iOS app can find it without a
  manually entered URL.
- Pushes the basic ContentState fields used by the Lock Screen widget:
  track / artist / album / isPlaying / startedAt / endsAt / groupMemberCount.
- Album art is **not** delivered via push yet (`albumArtThumbnail = nil`)
  — the widget falls back to its on-device cache, same path it uses today
  for the local-update flow. Phase 2 will fetch and downsample art on the
  relay and embed it.
- Hue Ambience config is uploaded from the iOS app. The relay stores the
  Hue app key and assignments in `DATA_DIR/hue-ambience-config.json`, then
  applies album-palette transitions on Sonos play/track changes.
  The iOS Light Motion Speed setting controls the flow interval; set
  `HUE_FLOW_INTERVAL_SECONDS` only when the NAS should override that value.
  Mapped Entertainment Areas use the private Hue EDK sidecar for Hue
  Entertainment streaming effects, with CLIP v2 color rotation as a Music
  Ambience fallback when sync is unavailable.
- Counter-Strike 2 Game State Integration payloads can be posted directly to
  the relay. When Hue Ambience config has CS2 sync enabled and at least one
  mapped Entertainment Area, the relay renders low-latency game lighting from
  the latest local-player state. Competitive and deathmatch use separate
  strategies; competitive spectator/death state falls back to low-brightness
  ambience.

External access (DDNS IPv6 / Cloudflare Tunnel / Tailscale) is intentionally
out of scope here; bring up the LAN path first, then layer on whichever
external transport once Phase 1 is verified.

## Quick start (QNAP + Portainer)

1. **Copy `.env.example` → `.env`**. Leave `SONOS_SEED_IP` empty for SSDP
   auto-discovery. Leave `APNS_KEY_ID` blank for now; the relay starts in
   *dry-run* mode until a `.p8` key is mounted.
2. **Deploy via Portainer** — Stacks → Add stack, paste the contents of
   `docker-compose.yml`, attach `.env` under "Environment variables", deploy.
   The stack pulls `forgejo.charmmmz.xyz/charm/charm-for-sonos/nas-relay:latest` and
   `forgejo.charmmmz.xyz/charm/hue-edk-sidecar:latest` by default.
   If either Forgejo package is private, log in first with a Forgejo token that
   can read packages. Override `NAS_RELAY_IMAGE` or `HUE_EDK_SIDECAR_IMAGE` in
   `.env` if you publish either image under a different package path.
3. **Verify**:
   ```bash
   curl http://<qnap-ip>:8787/api/health
   ```
   Should return JSON with `sonos.discoveryStatus: "ready"` and at least one
   entry under `groups[]`. The first sample takes a few seconds while the relay
   enumerates speakers. If your network blocks multicast discovery, set
   `SONOS_SEED_IP` to any always-on speaker IP and restart the stack.
   On the NAS itself, the Hue EDK sidecar should also answer:
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8788/health
   ```
   The sidecar binds to loopback by default, so this second check is not
   expected to work from another LAN device. If relay health refuses the
   connection, the iOS app will treat NAS sync as unavailable and keep using
   phone-side Hue sync.
4. **Open the iOS app settings**. Leave the Relay URL field blank. The app
   browses for `_charmrelay._tcp` and uses the first healthy relay it finds.
   Enter a manual URL only for cross-subnet networks, tunnels, or Bonjour
   discovery failures.
5. **Watch logs** (Portainer → Containers → relay → Logs). Play / pause
   / change track on Sonos and you should see lines like:
   ```
   [DRY-RUN] would push Live Activity update { trackTitle: …, isPlaying: true, … }
   ```
   This means everything is wired up correctly except APNs itself.

## Going live (after Apple Developer account is in)

1. Apple Developer Portal → Certificates → Keys → Create a new "Apple Push
   Notifications service (APNs)" key. Download the `.p8` file (one-time —
   you cannot re-download).
2. Note the **Key ID** (10-char string shown next to the key). `APNS_TEAM_ID`
   already defaults to `3MSS7DJGVR` for this app; change it only if you build
   under a different Apple Developer team.
3. Drop the `.p8` into the mounted volume:
   ```bash
   ssh admin@<qnap>
   cp ~/AuthKey_ABCDEF1234.p8 /share/Container/sonos-live-activity-relay/data/apns.p8
   chmod 600 /share/Container/.../data/apns.p8
   ```
4. Update `.env`:
   ```
   APNS_KEY_ID=ABCDEF1234
   APNS_TEAM_ID=3MSS7DJGVR
   APNS_PRODUCTION=false   # Xcode debug/sandbox APNs
   ```
5. Restart the stack. Relay log will print `APNs provider ready` instead of
   `running in DRY-RUN mode`. `/api/health` also reports `apns.mode: "ready"`
   when the key is usable, or `apns.mode: "dry-run"` with missing fields when
   setup is incomplete.

Set `APNS_PRODUCTION=true` for TestFlight or App Store builds. Keep it
`false` for Xcode-installed debug builds because those use APNs sandbox
tokens.

The bundle ID defaults to `com.charm.SonosWidget` (matches your iOS
project); change `APNS_BUNDLE_ID` if you renamed it. The APNs topic is
automatically suffixed with `.push-type.liveactivity`, which is what Apple
requires for Live Activity pushes.

### Live Activity push-to-start

The relay can start the iOS Live Activity when Sonos playback begins. The iOS
app must have run at least once after install so it can upload an ActivityKit
push-to-start token. APNs must be configured with `APNS_KEY_ID`,
`APNS_TEAM_ID`, `APNS_KEY_PATH`, `APNS_PRODUCTION`, and `APNS_BUNDLE_ID`.

Expected flow:

1. Open Charm Player once on the iPhone while the relay is reachable.
2. Confirm `/api/health` reports `apns.mode: "ready"` and
   `liveActivity.startTokenCount > 0`.
3. Start playback on the selected Sonos group without opening the app.
4. The relay sends an APNs `start` push.
5. iOS creates the Live Activity and reports an update token back to
   `/api/register-activity`.

Use a real iPhone for this check. APNs push-to-start cannot be fully validated
in the simulator. Before playback, a healthy response should include:

```json
{
  "apns": { "mode": "ready" },
  "liveActivity": {
    "startTokenCount": 1,
    "updateTokenCount": 0
  }
}
```

Expected relay log sequence after playback starts:

```text
live_activity action=apns-start trigger=sonos-change groupId=<group>
live_activity action=register-request groupId=<group> activityId=<activity>
live_activity action=apns-update trigger=register-initial groupId=<group>
```

The iPhone should show one Live Activity, update its track metadata, and avoid
creating a duplicate when the app is opened later.

### Counter-Strike 2 Game State Integration

Create this file on the gaming PC:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg\gamestate_integration_charm.cfg
```

Use the relay host or NAS IP in the `uri`:

```text
"Charm Sonos Relay"
{
 "uri" "http://<relay-ip-or-hostname>:8787/api/cs2/gamestate"
 "timeout" "5.0"
 "buffer" "0.1"
 "throttle" "0.1"
 "heartbeat" "5.0"
 "data"
 {
   "provider" "1"
   "map" "1"
   "round" "1"
   "player_id" "1"
   "player_state" "1"
   "player_match_stats" "1"
 }
}
```

After launching CS2 and joining a match, verify ingestion:

```bash
curl http://<relay-ip-or-hostname>:8787/api/cs2/status
```

You should see a `providers[]` entry with the provider SteamID, player name,
team, health, flash/burning values, bomb state, and map name.

For field research, clear existing samples and then listen to the live debug
stream while performing one action at a time in game:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://<relay-ip-or-hostname>:8787/api/cs2/debug/recent
curl -N http://<relay-ip-or-hostname>:8787/api/cs2/debug/stream
```

Each `event: state` message contains the raw Valve GSI payload plus relay
metadata such as the provider SteamID, receive time, and request source IP.

### Internal Sonos API (for `nas-agent`)

All routes require header **`X-Internal-Token: $INTERNAL_API_TOKEN`**. If `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` is unset, these routes return **503**.

| Method | Path | Body / Params | Description |
|--------|------|---------------|-------------|
| GET | `/internal/sonos/groups` | — | Cached snapshots for all discovered coordinators (`groupId` = coordinator LAN IP). |
| GET | `/internal/sonos/state` | `?groupId=` | Refresh AVTransport snapshot for one group. |
| POST | `/internal/sonos/play` | `{ groupId }` | Play / resume. |
| POST | `/internal/sonos/pause` | `{ groupId }` | Pause. |
| POST | `/internal/sonos/next` | `{ groupId }` | Next track. |
| POST | `/internal/sonos/previous` | `{ groupId }` | Previous track. |
| POST | `/internal/sonos/volume` | `{ groupId, volume }` | Group volume 0–100. |

`groupId` is whatever string the iOS app assigns to a Sonos coordinator —
it doesn't have to match Sonos's internal `RINCON_…` UUID, the only
requirement is that the same value is used both in `register-activity`
and inside the relay (it does today via the bridge's `groupName ?? uuid`).

## Future phases

- Phase 2 polish: external access (Tailscale / DDNS IPv6), token rotation
  edge cases, album-art forwarding via APNs, multi-group iOS UI.
- Auth: shared-secret header on register/unregister once we leave the LAN.
- Observability: Prometheus `/metrics` if it ever feels needed.
